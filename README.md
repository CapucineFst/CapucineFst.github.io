In this repository you'll find my project for Openclassrooms. It's the third project of the Web developper course. 
There are the HTML files and you'll also find two folders, one with my CSS and another one with my SASS. 
My code is originally written in SASS, the extension Live Sass Compiler on VS code convert it to CSS automatically. 

The main page is index.html, the four others are menus of restaurants.
